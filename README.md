BlackCat's Dotfiles

A minimalist and productive environment for development, powered by dwm, st, and other Suckless tools.

## About This Setup

These are my personal configuration files, finely tuned for a keyboard-driven workflow with a strong focus on minimalism and efficiency. The philosophy is simple: use lightweight, performant tools that do one thing and do it well. This setup is built around the Suckless philosophy (https://suckless.org/), meaning the software is simple and minimal.
The goal is to create a distraction-free environment that maximizes screen real estate and minimizes resource usage, allowing for deep focus on development and productivity tasks.
